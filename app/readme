Overview:
A RESTful API developed with FastAPI, integrated with PostgreSQL, and documented using Swagger. This API allows for CRUD operations on blog posts.

Technologies:
Backend Framework: FastAPI
Database: PostgreSQL
ORM: SQLAlchemy
Data Validation: Pydantic
Database Connection: psycopg2
API Documentation: Swagger (automatically generated by FastAPI)

Features:
CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete blog posts.
Database Integration: Connects to a PostgreSQL database for data persistence.
Error Handling: Provides appropriate HTTP responses for various conditions (e.g., 404 Not Found).
Asynchronous Startup: Ensures database connectivity before starting the API.


Components:
main.py: Defines API endpoints for managing blog posts, including /, /post, /createpost, /post/{id}, /deletepost/{id}, and /put/{id}.
database.py: Configures SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL, defines database connection management, and provides a get_db dependency.
models.py: Contains SQLAlchemy ORM model definitions, including the Post table schema.
schemas.py: Defines Pydantic models for data validation and serialization.

Responsibilities:
Designed and implemented RESTful endpoints using FastAPI.
Configured SQLAlchemy for database interactions and managed PostgreSQL connectivity.
Implemented data validation with Pydantic and ensured API documentation with Swagger.
Managed error handling and provided meaningful HTTP responses.
